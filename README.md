Project: investment-and-loan-calculator          


This application will ask you to choice between either investing or borrowing.
If you choose investing, the application will ask you to input the amount you are investing, then the apr rate, using deciamls and finally the number of years deposited.
This will then print out a list, showing the amount of money you would accumulate for every year, up to the year you chose. 
If you choose borrowing, the application will ask you for the amount you are borrwing, the interest rate using decimals and finally the number of years you have to pay it off. The application will then end.
The application will then output the total amount you owe, the amount you need to pay yearly and the amount you would need to pay monthly. The application will then end.

You can run the project by using the python workflow that is attached to Github.
This is my first project that i have made. You are free to use as you wish.
